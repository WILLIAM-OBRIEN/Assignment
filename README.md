There are 3 stages to the ui:

1. Stage 0
  Just an introduction wall of text to give setting.

2. Stage 1
  Spaceship stage where there are small animations and a planet.
  
3. Stage 2 
  Final stage where the user can interact with the different planet regions and it gives flavor text.
  
To interact with the ui, you must be able to press any key on the key board and use the left and right click mouse buttons. 

It is untested for macs so I am only aware that it works on windows machines. I have tested it on 2 different computers and the default 
resolution works perfectly.
